level that was not overpowering and was just dripping with ripe nectarine flavour; phenomonal beer!   \n","2227  2014 bruery black tuesday\\n19.7%\\n\\nseen these on shelves for $50 dollars and it honestly just tastes like deths tar just a bit thinner and a bit less sweety but more boozy even after 8+years .\\npoured out very light brown( i expected a darker and thicker pour for obvious reasons)and settles dark brown into glass. no head whatsoever. a lil bit of bubbles swimmin up like salmon .\\n\\ntastes is dark chocolate, caramel , big dark fruit and heavily roasted malts with a harsh boozy finish. nothing special.\\nway too boozy as well. i feel the burn in my stomach from each sip and it gotten bit overwhelming after 4 sips.\\nmouthfeel is too thin for the high abv in my opinion.\\n\\nalways wanted to try this one and very happy i did. to whoever sent me this one a million thanks cuz much happier i didn't get suckered in to paying what those bastards are asking for these bottles .\\n\\ni'm not afan of the bruery mainly cuz of the prices they charge( i get it gotta pay for barrel storage)and weird ass beers they make , but may buy one so happens it's tuesday once a year in pint can .\\n<br/>\\noverall i can see why no ones gives a fuck about these guys anymore. this is nothing special compared to a lot of stuff on shelves now and tastes way too hot even after 8 years. makes sense why most members of their beerclub have 750s spoiling in their cellars cuz this is hard to finish and can't imagine getting through half the bottle alone.<br/>\\n<br/>\\nupdate : still have 1/3rd of the bottle in my fridge 3 days later cuz i didn't wanna drink anymore. <br/>\\nthe price they charge for these is a crime. <br/>\\n<br/>\\npro tip: if you been wondering about this and don't wanna buy cuz of the price tag just buy a bottle of bourbon ... you'll be better off   \n","2670

haze at all, super clear. super tasty. seek it out!   \n","3502                                  (16 oz can, canned on 11/18/22, f5670; purchased 4-pack off shelf at shangy's... poured into a fat tulip)\\n\\nl: slightly-hazy medium amber-colored liquid; not a huge head on the pour, but it's tight with a frayed cotton contour... only holds a thin collar, thin misty cap; does leave a big band of lace oppo of sip spot\\n\\ns: very floral initial pop (rosewater), followed by some fleshy orange pulp, lemon/grapefruit zest, background hint of pine... a little honeyish malt wants to poke through... gummy orange slices... only a soft essence of alcohol... excellent overall intensity\\n<br/>\\nt: citrus kiss, but a rush of florality right behind it... the aftertaste is spicy, with a green bitterness that slowly swells... certainly a big malty base, with a muffin/cakey quality, but it's sodden with hop resins... vague dried pale-colored fruit (apricot, sultana) slowly creeps into the aftertaste, while the residual bitterness grows some peppery hair to it... the volume on the bitterness just keeps increasing, speakers cracking and shaking; hop artifacts emerge<br/>\\n<br/>\\nf: its bitter bite takes hold on the tongue, mildly intensified by the ethanol, which sets and singes (and yet cools?!) a touch near the back of the palate... its body and resins make for a silky lusciousness up front, giving way to a growing heat; soft carbonation<br/>\\n<br/>\\no: why did this take so long to be released out east here(?), especially considering furious had been here for years now; this was the first surly beer i ever heard of c. 2011 (though darkness and bender weren't far behind)... i am going to try the next can in a pint, which they're website suggests is the preferred vessel... aggressive and comforting (2081)   \n","3949

reviewed 14/05/23 (review 3101). note that i use dd/mm/yy protocol.\\ntop rim of can stamped “sticky stacks 03.06.23”. stored at 34 degrees at home. served at 46.2 degrees f in a hand washed and dried jester king snifter. the final temperature was 54.5 degrees f. \\nappearance – 4.25 \\nfirst pour – amber brown (srm 18), clear.\\nbody – black (srm 40), opaque. under direct light, same. when rear lite, opaque with light penetration at the edges – ruby.\\nhead: average (maximum 1.1 cm, aggressive center pour), tan, high density, quickly diminishing, reducing to a 0.2 cm crown constantly renewed by carbonation, and a thin partial cap. \\nlacing – poor. thin line of near-microscopic bubbles.\\naroma – 4.5 – when the tab is popped, instant aroma of coffee and maple syrup! weak roasted malt, no hops, no yeast. no ethanol (11 % abv as marked on the label). \\nflavor – 3.5 – moderately bitter coffee with maple syrup flavor as backing. bitterness enhanced by the char flavor. no malt, no yeast, no hops. no dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. slight gastric warming. \\npalate – 4 – medium; watery short of syrupy/creamy; soft carbonation.\\nfinal impression and summation: 4 without the char bitterness, i would have rated the flavor 4.5; for my taste buds, the char nearly ruined the maple/coffee combo. otherwise, this is a very good coffee stout. and that “natural flavor and caramel color” screams “unnecessary crap added”.   \n","\n","      compound_sentiment  \n","3203             -0.7545  \n","2227             -0.8613  \n","2670             -0.8674  \n","3502
